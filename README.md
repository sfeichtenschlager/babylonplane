# BabylonPlane
## Introduction
This is a small website made with BabylonJS.
Most of the code isn't made by me, you can already find it on the [BabylonJS website](https://babylonjs.com/) or the [BabylonJS forum](https://forum.babylonjs.com/).
If you want to play around with BabylonJS, use the [Babylon Playground](https://playground.babylonjs.com/). It can also be found on the official website linked above.
You can download the progress you have made there, save and reload it later.
## The BabylonJS Plane
To use the website, switch to [https://sfeichtenschlager.github.io/babylonplane] or just simply click the link.
It's my goal to make this website usable for as many devices as possible, so everyone can try out BabylonJS.
